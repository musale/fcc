  <div class="container">
    <div class="jumbotron"><p class="lead">He is a Finnish-American <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering">software engineer</a> who is the creator, and for a long time, principal developer of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel</a>, which became the kernel for operating systems such as the <b><em>Linux operating system, Android, and Chrome OS</em></b>.

      <p>
        Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland in 1969. He is the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds and the grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds. Both of his parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority. Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize–winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code Linux and the Open Source Revolution, Torvalds is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this makes him half "Nobel Prize–winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon character".
